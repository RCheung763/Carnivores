# Carnivores

I have been working on this project as a graduate research assistant in the mathematics department, in collaboration with a professor from the biology department. The dataset consists of 3,522 submissions collected from carnivorespotter.com, a platform that gathers citizen reports of carnivore sightings. These sightings include black bears, bobcats, cougars, coyotes, red foxes, raccoons, and river otters, contributing to the Seattle Urban Carnivores Project. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a model capable of classifying these submissions by sentiment, allowing for detailed analysis of the sentiments associated with each carnivore species sighted.
